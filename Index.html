Trading on margin can be dangerous because, if you're wrong about the direction in which the stock will go, you can lose siginificant cash.

                            When you short-sell a stock, you borrow shares from someone else with the promise to return them at a point down the road. You then sell the stock for a profit. It's a way to take advantage of a stock that you believe will decrease in price. After you sell short, you can buy back the shares at the lower price point and take the difference in price as your profit. I use short selling on a regular basis. It's often a smart move in a volatile market if you see patterns that indicate a sharp downward turn for a stock.

For instance, if a trader is willing to trade XYZ stock for $10 and a buyer is willing to pay $9 for it, the spread is $1.

                            The price movements of a stock or the stock market as a whole. Highly volatile stocks are those with extreme daily up and down movements and wide intraday trading ranges. This is often common with stocks that are thinly traded or have low trading volumes. I'm a big fan of high-volatility stocks becuase I can make a big profit off spikes or dips, depending on how I'm trading, in a short period of time. High volatility often makes trading more exciting, but it's also risky if you're inexperienced.

                            Often refers to the measure of the return on an investment that is received from the payment of a dividend. This is determined by dividing the annual dividend amount by the price paid for the stock. If you bought stock XYZ for $40 per share and it pays a $1.00-per-year dividend, you have a "yield" of 2.5 percent.

                            A pip is the price move in a given exchange rate. Understanding the change in value helps traders to enter, or edit orders to manage their trading strategy. A pip measures the amount of change in the exchange rate for a currency pair, and is calculated using last decimal point. Since most major currency pairs are priced to 4 decimal places, the smallest change is that of the last decimal point which is equivalent to 1/100 of 1%, or one basis point. For a trader to say "I made 40 pipd on the trade" for instance, means that the trader profited by 40 pips. The actual cash amount this represents depends on the pip value. Pip=0.0001. Yen-based currency pip= 0.01.

                            OANDA introduced fractional pips, known as "pipettes" to allow for tighter spreads. A fractional pip is equivalent to 1/10 of a pip, making it possible to view the EUR/USD currency pair with pipettes to five decimal places, while currency pairs with the yen as the quote currency to three decimal places. Pipettes are displayed in superscript format in the quote panel.

                            The monetary value of each pip depends on three factors: the currency pair being traded, the size of the trade, and the exchange rate. Based on these factors the fluctuation of even a single pip can have a significant impact on the value of the open position. Example : Assume that a $1,525,500 trade involving the USD/CAD pair is closed at 1.0568 after gaining 20 pips.
